# The aim of the ASICA prediction project was to predict a winner for this years Superbowl using some statistical analysis.
The intial goal of the project was to simulate the remaining games for this season, and predict the final records for each team at the end of the regular season, which would
shape the playoff picture. Due to inexperience this model is not extremely detailed, or sophisticated, and is more basic and fundamental. The model will predict winners
based on a teams offensive and defensive metrics, and their total points earned per game.
